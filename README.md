# LeeEtAlLooming
Experimental and analysis code used in "Three-dimensional motion perception: comparing speed and speed change discrimination for looming stimuli" by Lee, Ales and Harris (in prep). The code is implemented in psychtoolbox and MATLAB.

The psychMaster and helperFunctions folders contain all files needed to run the experiments described in this paper. The Analysis folder contains MoveLinePsychometricAnalysis, which can be used to analyse our data. Our data is available at https://osf.io/xvs5n/.
